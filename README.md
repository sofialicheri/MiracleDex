### üñãÔ∏è Reflection
Using GitHub, at the beginning, affected me negatively. My other class practice projects began all loading to the repository and I could not figure out a way to delete them, and thus I had to restart my repository and place the items to upload in a directory for easier selection.
After the initial struggle was over, I began getting more comfortable adding and committing changes, which was extremely useful for the updates of the project during different days.
Especially when I began experimenting in how to update a current card to display the detailed information, saving and pushing my successful changes was key before I would try the next part.
This project allowed me to get direct basic experience tracking changes and updates to code through Git and GitHub, which has been especially useful after the fast class lesson we had on it!

## üß† Final Reflection
This app was inspired by the work of the soon-to-be canonized Bl. Carlo Acutis, who did the first website on information about eucharistic miracles he collected from around the world.
The app consists on a display of a set of multiple cards containing information about several miracles including eucharistic miracles, healing miracles, marian apparitions, and incorrupt saints!
The purpose intended in the creation of the app is that by following the steps of the young saint, I may showcase the beauty of God's reminders of His infinite Mercy and Love for us through the visible expressions in miracles, putting my newly learned skills to the service and honor of God.

The hardest challenge in the development of this app was the step between fetching the data and creating a new card for each that can be then updated when clicking "Learn More" or "Close".
I am very proud of having pushed to get the card to truly expand and even change the button name, text, and function when updating the card - instead of giving up when I though all I could do is display the details of the selected miracle at the top of the screen!
This improvement makes the user experience of the app more smooth, structured, and organized!

I would love to hear what your favorite miracle is! Feel free to reach me at **sofia.licheri@my.avemaria.edu** to share your thoughts or suggest a new miracle for the collection!

## Acknowledgment and References

This project was developed using guidance from ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025). ChatGPT was used to assist with:
- Structuring the HTML layout into header and grid sections by providing guiding dimensions with margins, padding, and grip-gap in rems.
- Aligning and centering CSS Grid cards in the responsive screen.
- Saving each miracle and creating a card for each, with the addList to class and createElement functions.
- Helped me in adding these two lines:
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  to fix the @media code that was not working on my phone as desired.
- Guided me in the batch size slicing for my button to correctly split the dataset.
- Corrected my error in my attempt to update and expand the card to show miracle details.

The content was mostly based on my own prior notes and assignments from the class lectures and practice, and adapted with ChatGPT‚Äôs assistance for layout improvements.
