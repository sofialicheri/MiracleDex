### 🖋️ Reflection
How did using GitHub affect your development process? What new Git or GitHub skills did you gain?
Using GitHub, at the beginning, affected me negatively. My other class practice projects began all loading to the repository, and I could not figure out a way to delete them, and thus I had to restart my repository and place the items to upload in a directory for easier selection.
After the initial struggle was over, I began getting more comfortable adding and committing changes, which was very useful for the updates of the project during different days.

## 🧠 Final Reflection

Imagine you're explaining this project to a friend who doesn’t code. What does your app do? What are you most proud of? What was the hardest part to get working?

Reflect on both the technical and the spiritual aspects of building a project about Catholic miracles.

## Acknowledgment and References

This project was developed using guidance from ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025). ChatGPT was used to assist with:
- Structuring the HTML layout into header and grid sections by providing guiding dimensions with margins, padding, and grip-gap in rems.
- Aligning and centering CSS Grid cards in the responsive screen.
- Saving each miracle and creating a card for each, with the addList to class and createElement functions.
- Helped me in adding these two lines:
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  to fix the @media code that was not working on my phone as desired.
- Guided me in the batch size slicing for my button to correctly split the dataset.

The content was mostly based on my own prior notes and assignments from the class lectures and practice, and adapted with ChatGPT’s assistance for layout improvements.
